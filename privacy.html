  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>AfterSmile is committed to protecting the privacy and confidentiality of both practitioners and patients. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle personal data:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>AfterSmile does not collect, store, or transmit any user or patient data to external servers or third parties.</li>
    <li>All captured images remain stored exclusively on the user’s device. The application does not perform cloud backups or remote syncing.</li>
    <li>Automatic facial blurring is applied locally at the point of image capture to support patient confidentiality and prevent identity exposure.</li>
    <li>Users are responsible for adhering to relevant privacy laws and securing informed consent from patients when capturing and/or sharing images.</li>
    <li>We do not access, analyze, or share any data processed through the application.</li>
    <li>Should this policy be revised in the future, users will be notified through official update channels within the application.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If you have any concerns or inquiries regarding this policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@aftersmile.app">privacy@aftersmile.app</a>.</p>
