                <p>Thirty days from now, you could have a portfolio that transforms consultations into committed patients. Here's your step-by-step roadmap.</p>

                <h2>Week 1: Foundation (Days 1-7)</h2>

                <p><strong>Day 1:</strong> Download AfterSmile. Set up your folder structure by procedure type (veneers, whitening, implants, orthodontics, full mouth).</p>

                <p><strong>Days 2-4:</strong> Photograph your three best existing cases. Find before photos in your records, capture current aftershots if patients are still active. These become your foundation.</p>

                <p><strong>Days 5-7:</strong> Practice the photography basics. Designate your photo spot, test lighting, perfect your angles. Photograph yourself to understand the patient perspective.</p>

                <h2>Week 2: Momentum (Days 8-14)</h2>

                <p><strong>Daily habit:</strong> Every completed case gets documented. No exceptions. Before, during (if applicable), and after.</p>

                <p><strong>Quality filter:</strong> Not every case makes your portfolio. Select only transformations that make people say "wow." You need 5-8 strong cases total to see results.</p>

                <p><strong>Organization:</strong> Tag each case immediately. Procedure type, complexity, special notes. Future you will thank present you.</p>

                <h2>Week 3: Curation (Days 15-21)</h2>

                <p><strong>Days 15-17:</strong> Review everything. Keep your absolute best. Remove anything that doesn't demonstrate clear transformation. Twenty stunning cases beat fifty mediocre ones.</p>

                <p><strong>Days 18-19:</strong> Create your "consultation kit" - your 5-7 go-to cases organized for instant access. These are your closers.</p>

                <p><strong>Days 20-21:</strong> Practice presenting. Pull up cases within 10 seconds. Know the story behind each transformation. Smooth delivery matters.</p>

                <h2>Week 4: Launch (Days 22-30)</h2>

                <p><strong>Days 22-24:</strong> Start showing in consultations. Every. Single. One. Track your before/after case acceptance rates. Watch them climb.</p>

                <p><strong>Days 25-27:</strong> Share on social media. One transformation per day. Simple caption: problem → solution → invitation to learn more.</p>

                <p><strong>Days 28-30:</strong> Update your website. Add your portfolio page. Feature before-and-afters prominently. Make your best work impossible to miss.</p>

                <h2>The Daily 5-Minute Routine</h2>

                <p>Building a portfolio isn't about marathon sessions. It's about daily consistency:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Morning:</strong> Check today's schedule. Identify potential documentation opportunities.</li>
                    <li><strong>After each case:</strong> Capture and save (2 minutes max).</li>
                    <li><strong>End of day:</strong> Review, select best shots, organize (3 minutes).</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Five minutes daily compounds into a marketing asset worth thousands monthly.</p>

                <h2>What Success Looks Like After 30 Days</h2>

                <p>You'll have:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>10-15 portfolio-worthy transformations across procedure types</li>
                    <li>A consultation flow that converts 50-70% higher</li>
                    <li>Social proof attracting new patients actively</li>
                    <li>Confidence showing what you can achieve</li>
                    <li>A system that keeps building value automatically</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>The Secret Accelerator</h2>

                <p>Want faster results? Focus on your highest-value procedures first. One stunning veneer transformation is worth ten whitening cases for attracting premium patients.</p>

                <p>Document everything, but curate strategically. Your portfolio should reflect the practice you want to build, not just the work you're currently doing.</p>

                <h2>Your Day 1 Action Steps</h2>

                <ol>
                    <li>Download AfterSmile now</li>
                    <li>Photograph your best existing case before lunch</li>
                    <li>Set a daily reminder: "Document transformation"</li>
                    <li>Tell one team member your 30-day goal</li>
                    <li>Commit to the process</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Thirty days. That's all it takes. The difference between where you are and where you want to be isn't skill or time - it's systematic documentation and strategic presentation.</p>

                <p>Start today. Your future portfolio is built one case at a time, starting now.</p>
